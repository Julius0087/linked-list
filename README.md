# linked-list
The Odin Project assignment for linked lists in Ruby.
## Description
A ruby script with my solution to linked list assignment in TOP. It contains the linked list class with all the required methods (extra credit ones too) and the node class for individual nodes.
## Thoughts
At first I was really confused as to how to implement linked list in Ruby, but after some thought I managed to put it together. After it clicked, the rest of the methods were pretty easy but fun to write.
